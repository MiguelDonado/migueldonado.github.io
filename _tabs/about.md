# **About me**
Hi 👋 I'm Miguel Ángel, welcome to my blog. I'm a student of the MSc Statistics and Operations Research in the UPC (Barcelona) and I love to learn, the main reason is because it helps to better oneself, and that seems to me a reasonable purpose to chase in life. I'm super excited to open this blog and being able to share what I'm learning.

I started this blog for two reasons:
1. **Learn better**: 
   > You learn about 10% of what you read, 20% of what you listen to, 70% of what you actively interact in some way and about 90% of what you teach
   
   I had always said that I didn't like to teach, mainly because I was interested in keep learning and teaching seemed to me as an activity that to do once you have learned all about your field (quite a naive approach). Also I have always found quite difficult to express with words what's going inside my mind regarding some topic I've learned.

   Casualty or not, I have found these last year some quotes, insights related to the best way to learn. The people that said those quotes, were Richard Feynmann, Terence Tao, Grant Sanderson. All of them turn around the concept of teaching as the best method to learn, and it makes sense!

   Sometimes we believe that we have grasp everything, all makes sense inside our mind, but when we try to explain it to the external world, we realize we have some gap in our understanding of the topic. That explains pretty good why I have always found more difficult to explain the learned topics with words, because is only when you expose your knowledge when you realize if you have all the dots connected or not.
2. **Contribute my grain of salt to the community**:
   I have used for years, ton of free educational content that is on the internet, is amazing how there is almost always some resource to learn or solve anything. So, I felt in debt with the community, and likely I will always be (they've provided to me awesome learning resources and I will try to provide in my own way some insight of the things that I'm learning). So I opened this blog with the aim of trying to reduce my debt with the community 😅. 
   
## **A little bit about myself**
I have always liked sports, but during the last year I have focused on trail running and calishtenics, and I have tried to do each day at least one of them if not both. Is common knowledge that practicing sports is good for the body and health, but I do it mainly for the mind. 

| I prefer trail, but I also do "normal" running | Trail running (same than running but in the mountains) |

After having workout, the calm, the belief in oneself and the satisfaction of knowing that you went to run when you didn't want to do it, its something unvaluable. Our mind is quite powerful (I would say that more than what we normally think) so its very important to train it 
   > Usually to get where we wanna get, we are gonna have to do more things that we don't wanna do, than things we wanna do. 


I really like nature, I would much rather do a hike, than walk on Passeig de Gracia in Barcelona or Gran Via in Madrid 😄. Related to nature, I especially like trees, specially the ones we have in Galicia. Aditionally, while I'm having some walk, or whatever in the nature I like to watch animals during the walk (birds and whatnot, I particularly like the eagles).

I also like to travel, explore and discover great places that doesnt always have to be on the other side of the world, but a lot of times happen to be on the region where we live. 

I too consider myself a humble and modest person, I don't need expensive things to be happy. I don't care about expensive cars, clothes or restaurants, I just need some shoes to run, a pull-up bar, my laptop to learn about the stuff I like and knowing that the people I care about is happy and I don't need anything else.

*Exercise to train mind and learn new things to get better, as well as share good moments with the beloved ones, it seems like a good plan to chase in life. Winning the lotery won't change any of it* 

My interests are Machine Learning, specially Deep Learning as well as Mathematical Programming. I'm also very interested in entrepreneurship, my father ran a family company, and I always like what I saw. Being able to work on something that you believe in, and being able to make it grow must feel very good. I'm also interested in the austrian school of economics, the small knowledge I have about it is through some videos, but I have the pending task of going deeper and read some books about it. 

Its shocked to see all the things that human beings have done (telecomunnications, planes, healthcare to name a few), so I don't want to remain seated and take advantage of all of them without providing anything back, I would also like to contribute somehow in my own way.

Studying/working and do exercise allows to get better each day, and that's what drives me, trying to find the best version of myself, first of all so I won't have any regrets about what I could have been and secondly to show my best version to the people that is close to me.
